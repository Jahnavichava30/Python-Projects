This Python program uses the Tkinter library to build a simple flashcard application for learning French vocabulary. 
The application loads French words and their English translations from a CSV file (french_words.csv), and saves progress to another CSV file (words_to_learn.csv) as the user marks words as known.
Upon starting the program, it checks if there is an existing progress file. If not, it falls back to the default word list. 
The main window contains a canvas that displays each flashcard, which is initially shown in French, and after a few seconds, it flips to show the English translation. 
Users can click on the 'wrong' or 'right' buttons to either skip to the next word or mark the current word as known.
The application utilizes a timer to automatically flip the card after a set period (3 seconds), enhancing the learning experience by ensuring that the user is exposed to both languages efficiently. 
The saved progress allows users to continue from where they left off in future sessions.
