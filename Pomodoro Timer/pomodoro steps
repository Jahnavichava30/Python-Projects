Here are the steps for creating the Pomodoro Timer:

1. **Import Libraries**  
   - Import `Tkinter` for GUI and `math` for calculations.

2. **Define Constants**  
   - Set colors, fonts, and time intervals for work, short breaks, and long breaks.

3. **Create Reset Timer Function**  
   - Define a function to cancel the current timer, reset the UI, and set the session counter back to zero.

4. **Create Timer Start Function**  
   - Define a function to handle starting the timer, managing work/break intervals, and calling the countdown function.

5. **Create Countdown Function**  
   - Define a function to manage the countdown timer, update the display, and start the next session once a countdown ends.

6. **Set Up the GUI**  
   - Initialize the main window, labels, buttons, and canvas for the timer display.

7. **Configure Start and Reset Buttons**  
   - Add buttons to start the timer and reset it.

8. **Main Loop**  
   - Run the main event loop to keep the application running.

This is the flow of the Pomodoro Timer application in steps.
